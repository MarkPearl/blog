# Things to consider

* What would an ideal solution look like (before we build or buy it)
* What is the strategic advantage of this thing
* How much would it cost us to build and maintian this ourselves

# If you buy, what should you consider

* What are the indicators of success, what would need to go wrong to kill the project or exit

* Is this vendor alinged in values with our company
* Will they listen to us
* How do we sit in terms of importance with them  

# Other things

* What are the things that would make us revisit the build vs buy decision
* Does open source change things - consider cost to support it, is it fully secure
