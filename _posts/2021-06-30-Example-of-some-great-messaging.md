Recently, I received an email from a leader that I thought exemplified great communication around a tough topic. 
In an effort to use this going forward I've put the essence of the format used below.

Hi all,

I have some very unfortunate news.

Put explanation of what has happened.

Immediately we must:
* Put bullet point of what needs to happen
* Put bullet point of what needs to happen

This is a bit of an own-goal and own-goals aren't good, but we need to own it and take the immediate corrective action to re-establish confidence and trust in our processes, systems and implementation. This mandate will no doubt be disruptive to some existing work elements and for that I apologise. It is however necessary.

Many thanks
