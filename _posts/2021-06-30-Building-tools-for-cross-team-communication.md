Covid forced most teams to go remote.

# What's the impact / challenges of going from co-located to remote

* Re-creating trust and transparency that comes from co-located work
* Using confluence as a way to get information prior to a meeting, then focussing the meeting on covering the content
* Planning regular sessions to connect in person

# Mindsets/approaches to be more productive at meetings

* Take ten minutes to read the memo before getting into the meat of the meeting
* Instead of using the meeting for status updates, have everyone write down the status in a document together at the begining of the meeting and then review and discuss as a group
* Less status meetings and more work session
* Focus on metrics to communicate if things are on target
* Live dashboard become useful to communicate to a wider group the status of things

# How can we make sure people have a voice at the table?

* Using virtual hands so that people don't dominate a conversation
* Use anon Q&A to allow people to speak up that wouldn't normally speak up - but use a moderator approach to make sure questions are for the right forum.

# Working across timezones

* Being conscious of the timezones that people are in - these are the peoples working hours
* Being inclusive of people in timezones out of your area is hard
* Record meetings so people can watch it async
* Sometimes just have the meeting twice or X times for each timezone
* Sometimes for really important meetings people will need to start/work late to attend - make sure that is balanced
* Rethink teams to make sure teams are in the same timezone so that their normal collaboration works well

# What tools have you found that improve remote work

* Donut - randomly places you with people to schedule meetings that you haven't met with  
* Retros being recorded in slack so you have notes to refer back to  
* Having video on while in a meeting so people can feel involved and included  
* Stickies.io
